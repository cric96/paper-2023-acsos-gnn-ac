\begin{abstract}
Coordinatinating a group of smart agents in multi-agent systems 
 is a research problem that has been addressed for a long time, 
 due to the challenges posed by distribution and of the definition of distributed intelligence. 
%
The problem is even more evident in collective adaptive systems, 
 where the scale of the systems considered makes the definition of collective behaviors even more challenging. 

In this paper we consider a new reinforcement learning approach 
  for the definition of intelligent agents called \emph{Field-Informed reinforcement learning}, 
  where we use computational fields to manage the interaction between them in a stigmergic way 
  and Graph Neural Networks to learn the intelligence necessary to solve collective tasks. 
%
This allows us to create distributed controllers informed by a collective knowledge 
 distilled during learning but that use only local information at runtime.
% 
We demonstrate the effectiveness of this new approach in several case studies 
 where coordination tasks are successfully solved.
